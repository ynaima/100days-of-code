primitive data types - strings, intergers, floats, boolean(true and False)
you get type error (when you try to use a funtion or an operation with the wrong type)
for instance:
       len("hello") = 5
       len("123") = 3
       len(123)  = Type error
       print("helllo" + 3)  = gives type Error because we cannot concatenate strings with intergers

we can convert a type of data to a different type in order to avoid type Error 
to check type of a data use the type function
type(3) = < class 'int' >
  print("helllo" + str(3) ) = hello3

  print(70 +100) = 170
  print(str(70) + str(170)) = 70170


  MATHEMATICAL OPERATIONS IN PYTHON
  + -> for adding two numbers or concatenating strtings
  - -> for subtracting numbers
  * for multiplying numbers
  / for dividing numbers (gives back a float)
  // -> also called integer division (gives integer)  (5//2) = 2
  % -> module -gives the remaining of integer division  (5 % 2) = 1
  ** -> power    (2**2) = 4


  PRECEDENCE IN OPERATIONS
  () - go first 
  ** 
  */ ->same PRECEDENCE
  +-  - lowest PRECEDENCE


  N/B
  if they have the same precedence, then operation goes from left to right
  use of f-strings 
  use of rounf function
